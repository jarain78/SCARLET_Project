Currently the design of device wearable is increased, this is possible since of the new IoT devices. Different example as intel Edison and Intel Curie are some examples. My application is based on the utilization of this kind of devices, to connect our body to the cloud. Right now we can see different devices as smart watch, glasses, etc, but in some case these devices need more significant information.  Since only can acquire a litter bit part of our Bio-Information, this information could be used to monitor our vital sign and other application that can be used to introduce the human in to the IoT.  The Bio-Smart Wear can be used as element to monitoring patients, use as monitor in nursing homes or in our house. In the feature all people are connecting to the cloud, monitor your vital sing and detect the diseases through the clothes.
My Bio-SmartWear allow to acquire ECG signal, breathing frequency, body temperature and heart rate. The core of my project is base on in an Arduino-101, using your different advantage as your Ble-Bluetooth and your small size.

To run this project you need this software JASON:
